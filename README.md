🕵️‍♂️ Online Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

Online fraud has become increasingly common with the growth of digital transactions. This project focuses on building a machine learning–based fraud detection system that identifies fraudulent transactions by analyzing transaction patterns and user behavior.

The model helps classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, enabling faster and more accurate fraud prevention.

🎯 Objectives

Detect fraudulent online transactions using ML algorithms

Analyze transaction data to extract meaningful patterns

Improve accuracy and reduce false positives

Build an efficient and scalable fraud detection pipeline

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Machine Learning Algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

(Optional) XGBoost

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains transaction-related features such as:

Transaction amount

Transaction type

Time-based features

Account-related attributes

The target variable indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

Note: Due to privacy concerns, real-world datasets are anonymized or sourced from public repositories.
